          <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
          <p><strong>Last updated on 28-03-2025 19:59:41</strong></p>

          <p>
            At <strong>Jet Yatra</strong>, we are committed to providing a
            smooth and pleasant travel experience for all of our customers. In
            case you need to cancel or modify your travel plans, we have
            established the following Cancellation and Refund Policy to ensure
            fairness and clarity for all parties involved.
          </p>
          <div class="section-title">Cancellation Policy:</div>
          <p>
            We understand that plans can change unexpectedly. Therefore, we
            allow cancellations under the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cancellations will only be accepted if made within 24 hours of
              booking, provided the travel service has not yet been processed or
              confirmed with service providers (hotels, airlines, tours, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>
              For bookings that have already been confirmed and processed with
              our vendors, cancellations may incur charges based on the vendor’s
              policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cancellation requests must be made in writing, either through our
              customer support email or website contact form.
            </li>
            <li>
              Special packages, such as holiday packages or custom tours, may
              have different cancellation terms, which will be communicated at
              the time of booking.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <div class="section-title">Refund Policy:</div>
          <p>
            In case you decide to cancel your booking, the following refund
            conditions will apply:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              If you cancel your booking within the cancellation period (24
              hours after booking), you will be entitled to a full refund, minus
              any processing fees.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the cancellation request is made after the initial cancellation
              period, we will process a partial refund, subject to deductions
              from our service providers. The refund amount will depend on the
              cancellation policies of the airlines, hotels, and other service
              providers.
            </li>
            <li>
              For travel services such as flights or train bookings, which may
              have non-refundable tickets, you will only be refunded the amount
              recoverable from the third-party vendors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days after the
              cancellation is confirmed and once all third-party vendor refund
              processes are complete.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <div class="section-title">Damaged or Defective Services:</div>
          <p>
            If you experience issues with your travel services (such as damaged
            or unsatisfactory services), please contact our customer service
            team within 24 hours of experiencing the issue. We will work with
            our service providers to address the concern and process either a
            replacement or refund depending on the situation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="section-title">Force Majeure:</div>
          <p>
            In case of natural disasters, strikes, or any other force majeure
            event that causes travel disruption, we may not be able to process
            cancellations or refunds. In such cases, we will work with our
            service providers to offer alternative options or reschedule your
            travel plans.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div class="section-title">Refund Processing Time:</div>
          <p>
            Refunds, if applicable, will be processed to the original payment
            method. The exact timeline may vary depending on your payment
            provider but can take anywhere from 7 to 10 business days. Please
            contact us if you experience any delays beyond this period.
