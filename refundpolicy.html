          <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
          <p><strong>Last updated on 04-04-2025 17:12:36</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>ROHAN NAMDEV</strong> believes in helping its customers as
            far as possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy.
            Under this policy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              • Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
              immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation
              request may not be entertained if the orders have been
              communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the
              process of shipping them.
            </li>
            <li>
              • ROHAN NAMDEV does not accept cancellation requests for
              perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However,
              refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that
              the quality of product delivered is not good.
            </li>
            <li>
              • In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report
              the same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however,
              be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the
              same at his own end. This should be reported within 2 Days days of
              receipt of the products. In case you feel that the product
              received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations,
              you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 2
              Days days of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team
              after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate
              decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              • In case of complaints regarding products that come with a
              warranty from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In
              case of any Refunds approved by the ROHAN NAMDEV, it’ll take 1-2
              Days days for the refund to be processed to the end customer.
